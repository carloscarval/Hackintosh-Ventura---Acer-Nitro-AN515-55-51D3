## Current Status
- **Discrete graphic card** never going to work!
- **Touchpad Gestures** works after adding patched DSDT/SSDT (XOSI) in OC
- **Sound** Works perfectly.
- **HDMI** Won't work, since the port is hardwired to the dGpu (disabled). And this device doesn't support AltMode, so, in order to use it with HDMI, it's necessary to use an adapter with DisplayLink.
- **Everything else works**
